# Officially a blogger now
The blog is finally up and running! After restudying Git and HUGO for a couple of hours, and with the help of my brother, I was finally able to set the theme of the site and make my first post, [Il primo](https://esebyron.github.io/posts/il-primo/). I recommend you check it out if you are curious about why I decided to start a blog and what to expect from it.

### Something I want to share
Lately, I've been working on a song called "Avenida Prados del Norte." The name is a reference to another song called "Pacific Coast Highway" by Fukkk Offf. My song is also going to be an EDM type of music with some atmospheric sounds, a very energetic bassline, melodies, vocal chops, groovy drums, and more. I'm planning to have it finished by the second half of next month. I'll be publishing all my musical creations here with personal comments on how I made them for people who may be interested.

And that's it for today's post hope you have a wonderful day, ciao!
