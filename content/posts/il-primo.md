**My First Post for the World**

Howdy doodie macaronies\! I want to welcome you to my blog—a space where I plan to post my personal and professional achievements, daily life thoughts, new knowledge, brunch recipes, and, well, basically anything that comes to mind that I feel is worth sharing with, yes, someone like you, average internet user. 😉

**Presenting Myself and Why I Have This Blog**

I’m Byron, a very energetic guy with an insatiable curiosity. I’m friendly, talkative, and extroverted. Because of my curiosity, I’m always eager to learn new things, mainly arts like music production, video editing, and visual arts. Now, I am getting into web design to advance in my professional career, starting with this blog you’re reading.

My brother is teaching me how to use this thing called HUGO—a tool to help you create static websites in HTML using minimal coding knowledge. I’m excited about this project, as I have been thinking about getting an online portfolio for a couple of months already, but I do not want or feel motivated to use a visual interface web builder like a couple of famous ones out there because, in my personal experience, they tend to get a little bit too slow and frustrating with the services they want you to buy. And here I am, flexing my brain to try to place a visual theme and two posts like this one—a very exciting plot for a spaghetti western if you ask me. 🤣

There’s going to be more of this amazing adventures in the second part of this post, coming up very soon on this same web page, at all times, from anywhere you have an electronic device with access to the internet and a web browsing feature. See ya next post, bye! 👋🏼
